             <h4>Being a Kitchen Manager</h4>
              <p>What would we do without food? <br> Yes, you're right - Absolutely nothing! So, being a Kitchen Manager means that you literally hold the key to making everything happen. You're a Superhuman!</p>    
              <p>If you're like Ann though, you wouldn't be feeling very superhuman. Ann is Senior Chef and Kitchen Manager for Oslo Diner, which is great because we all love Oslo Diner. But, between creating gourmet dishes, managing kitchen staff, keeping inventory and restocking the kitchen, Ann is in an endless roller coaster that has ultimately yielded a decline in the charm and appeal of Oslo Diner. Who wants to travel all the way down to the Diner only to realize the kitchen is out of cheese (again)? Not me, and certainly not 50% of Oslo residents all whom have since switched kitchen choices.</p>
